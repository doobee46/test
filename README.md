## Quickstart

# Installation and Getting Started Guide for the "test" Project

Welcome to the "test" project! This guide will help you set up the project on your local environment. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth installation process.

## 1. Prerequisites and System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or above
- **npm**: Version 6.x or above (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: Version 2.x or above
- **Docker** (if using Docker): Version 20.x or above

You can check if you have these installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
docker -v
```

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Once you are inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 3. Environment Configuration

Create a copy of the environment example file and configure your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to set up your configuration values. You may need to adjust the settings based on your local environment:

```plaintext
# Example of .env configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
```

## 4. Database Setup

If your project requires a database, follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed):
   Follow the instructions on the [PostgreSQL official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your platform.

2. **Create a new database**:
   Access the PostgreSQL command line tool and create a new database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE test_db;
   ```

3. **Run migrations** (if applicable):
   If your project uses a migration tool, run the following command to set up your database schema:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

## 5. How to Start the Development Server

You can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 6. Verification Steps

To verify that everything is working correctly:

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You should see the homepage of the application.
- If the application is running properly, you should also see the logs in your terminal indicating that the server is listening.

## 7. Common Troubleshooting Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter during installation and how to resolve them:

- **Error: Port already in use**: If you see an error indicating that the port is already in use, try changing the port in your `.env` file or terminate the process using that port.
  
- **Module not found**: If a module is missing after running `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.

- **Database connection error**: Ensure that your database service is running and the configuration in your `.env` file is correct.

## 8. Next Steps for Developers

Now that your project is set up, consider exploring the following:

- **Read the source code**: Familiarize yourself with the project structure and logic.
- **Implement new features**: Look for issues in the repository to start contributing.
- **Run tests**: Ensure everything is working correctly by running:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
