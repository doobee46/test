# Usage Guide for the "test" Repository

Welcome to the usage guide for the **test** repository. This guide will walk you through the basic usage, configuration options, common use cases, advanced features, and best practices to help you get started effectively.

## Basic Usage Examples

To start using the application, you can follow these basic examples. Here’s how to set up and run the application:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd test

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

This will start the application on your local server. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Configuration Options

The application may have several configuration options to customize its behavior. Below are some of the configuration files and their purposes.

- **config/app-config.json**: This file contains application settings like the environment mode (development/production).
- **config/db-config.json**: Here you can configure database connection settings, including host, port, username, and password.

### Example of `app-config.json`

```json
{
  "environment": "development",
  "port": 3000
}
```

You can change the `environment` to `production` when deploying your application.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common use cases along with code examples to illustrate how to use the library effectively.

### Use Case 1: API Call

Let's say you want to make an API call to fetch user data.

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
  }
}

// Fetch user data for user with ID 1
fetchUserData(1);
```

### Use Case 2: Database Connection

You can set up a connection to your database as follows:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const dbConfig = require('./config/db-config.json');

mongoose.connect(`mongodb://${dbConfig.username}:${dbConfig.password}@${dbConfig.host}:${dbConfig.port}/mydatabase`, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
.then(() => console.log('Database connected!'))
.catch(error => console.error('Database connection error:', error));
```

## Advanced Features

The application may also have advanced features that enhance its functionality. Check for features like middleware for request handling, error handling, and logging.

### Middleware Example

Here’s how to set up middleware for logging requests:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request for '${req.url}'`);
  next();
});

// Define your routes here
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling in your code to manage exceptions and provide user-friendly error messages.
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information (like API keys and database credentials) instead of hardcoding them in your application.
3. **Code Documentation**: Document your code and APIs to help other developers understand how to use your application efficiently.
4. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with other developers.

## Important Notes and Warnings

- **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have all required dependencies installed. Check the `package.json` file for a list of dependencies.
- **Security**: Be cautious with user inputs and validate/sanitize them to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
- **Performance**: Monitor the performance of your application, especially when handling large datasets or high traffic.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively use and navigate the capabilities of the **test** repository. Happy coding!
